Hello everyone, I was successful in installing the RTL88x2BU driver for this adapter:

Techkey ac1200 wifi USB 3.0 adapter

On Kali linux 2022.4-live-amd64; as a live usb.


Additional Information about my Install of Kali Linux:
> `Kali*kali: uname -a`

-> Linux kali 6.0.0-kali3-amd64 1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.0.7-1kali1 (2022-11-07) x86_64 GNU/Linux

To Install RTL88x2BU Driver Use These Commands as Follows:
> `Kali*kali: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
> `Kali*kali: sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential bc dkms git libelf-dev`
> `Kali*kali: mkdir -p ~/src`
> `Kali*kali: cd ~/src`
> `Kali*kali: git clone https://github.com/morrownr/88x2bu-20210702.git`
> `Kali*kali: ls`
> `Kali*kali: cd /88x2bu-20210702`
> `Kali*kali: sudo ./install-driver.sh`
After installing I confirmed it supports monitor mode and injection.
